I joined [Delicious][] (formerly styled del.icio.us) yesterday. For
those of you living under a rock for the past decade, Delicious is the
original social bookmarking web service.<!--more-->

## problem

### multiple browsers

As a web geek, I run many browsers at once. A typical setup for me
would be:

   1. [Firefox][], under my development profile (which I have captured in
      [Automator][] and imaginatively named `FF dev`). Three to four
      windows open to various parts of the site I'm currently working on.
   1. Firefox, under my personal profile (captured in Automator). A
      dizzying set of windows and tabs open to reference material.
   1. Firefox, under my Facebook profile (yup, you guessed it). I have a
      major FB project going at present and check in regularly. On the
      other hand I value my concentration, so I have it sandboxed.
   1. [Chrome][], because Google docs and especially Google spreadsheets
      work best with chrome.
   1. [Safari][], because the [Safari Bookshelf][] seems happiest with
      Safari.

Bookmarks local to a single browser simply don't meet my needs.

### rich associations

I have hundreds of bookmarks, the vast majority of which link to a
selected entry page for an information-rich web resource. Choosing a
single slot in a rigid hierarchy for each bookmark is frustrating and
counter-productive. With in-browser bookmarks, I frequently find it
easier to search for the resource with a few strategic terms than to
recall in which of several related categories I put a particular
resource.

Delicious pioneered using those terms (called _tags_) as the
organizing principle for a set of bookmarks. Entering any of a
bookmark's tags will bring up that entry, along with any other
resources on which I have used the same tag. Tags not only eliminate
the frustration during bookmarking and ease retrieval, they facilitate
discovering new relations in the bookmarked materials.

While many browsers now support tagged bookmarks, that support is
limited to storing tags, leaving their use in retrieval to extensions.
Furthermore, tags really benefit from social support: a starter set 
of suggested tags can make all the difference between creating a rich
set of personalized tags and not using the feature at all.

### sync, sank, sunk

I've explored alternatives to in-browser bookmarks before. Several
years ago I researched the bookmark syncing services and even tried
Xmarks for a brief time. Xmarks syncing had a very noticeable impact
on my mac, however, so I dropped it. I will say that I was not a
particularly good fit for the syncing approach to bookmarks as I am
generally conservative when it comes to resources and syncing seems
like overkill to me.

### social, yes, promiscuous, no

I have liked the idea of a social bookmarking site from the
beginning. Having said that, I do not necessarily want all my
bookmarks to be public. Two situations in which I would use private
bookmarks that immediately come to mind are sites I have not yet
visited in any depth but plan to explore later and sites that
serve as examples of what not to do. 

Keeping two entirely separate sets of bookmarks: a public set in a
social bookmarking service and a private set of in-browser bookmarks
will inevitably reduce the richness of both sets, not to mention
increase my workload.

## solution

Enter Octopress. I have just moved my blog to Octopress (for some
value of moved; I still need to process the posts on my old blog but
decided not to let that delay launching the new one). One of
Octopress's default properties is that it integrates your Delicious
feed. How cool is that? Time to go revisit Delicious.

I explored Delicious shortly after it came out and again several years
later and decided not to use it. Both times the determining factor
was interaction design: the drag on my workflow was such that I was
confident it would get in the way of my productivity.

This time, however, I was pleasantly surprised. While it is early days
as of yet, I'm already integrating the beta bookmarklet into my
workflow. The interface is nice and clean, although even the 'compact'
version takes up a huge amount of space. But that's what user styles
are for...

I decided not to upload my bookmarks from my various browswers, but
rather to enter them as I came to them: I was due to sort through the
things anyway. 

Thanks, Octopress. Not only do I have a blogging platform on which
I can actually write again, but it looks like I may have an answer
to my perennial bookmark problem!
